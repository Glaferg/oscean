<h3>Parallel</h3>

<p>The slope of the first line is m1=(y<sup>2</sup>−y<sup>1</sup>)/(x<sup>2</sup>−x<sup>1</sup>) and the slope of the second is m2=(y<sup>4</sup>−y<sup>3</sup>)/(x<sup>4</sup>−x<sup>3</sup>). The lines are parallel if and only if m1=m2.</p>

<p>Let'?'s say we are given the center point of the circle and its radius. We can now create a loop which iterates from Center.x-Radius to Center.x+Radius or maybe even downwards from Center.x+Radius to Center.x-Radius. Now we have one point on the radius which is the center of the circle and one point which we have the X to, which is located on the circumference. We can then calculate the Y position of this point using the distance formula as in:</p>

<pre>Radius = Sqrt ((P1.x - P2.x) ^2 + (P1.y - P2.y) ^2)</pre>

<pre>
cos(x) = 1 - (x^2/2!) + (x^4/4!)...  (An even function)
sin(x) = x -(x^3/3!) + (x^5/5!)....  (An odd function)

add both series together but keep all signs positive and you have

e^x = 1 + x+ (x^2/2!) + (x^3/3!).....

So e^ipi + 1 =0
